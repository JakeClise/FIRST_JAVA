//every file is a class
//class name must be the same as the file name
//file & class name should be in PascalCase -- ex: BankAccount.java
//think of main as the launchpad for all applications
//in java, semicolons are required syntax for ending any statement
//TO COMPILE: javac NameOfFile.java
//TO RUN PROGRAM: java NameOfFile
//"WHENEVER YOU RUN A FILE, YOU GOTTA COMPILE"
